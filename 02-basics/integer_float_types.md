# Integer and Float Types in Go

Understanding the various integer and floating-point types in Go is crucial for efficient memory management and accurate numerical representation.

## Integer Types

Go offers signed and unsigned integers with varying bit sizes. The choice depends on the range of values needed and memory considerations.

### Signed Integers

*   **`int`**: The default integer type. Its size (32 or 64 bits) depends on the system architecture. It can represent both positive and negative numbers.
*   **`int8`**: Represents signed 8-bit integers. Range: -128 to 127. Uses 1 byte of memory.
*   **`int16`**: Represents signed 16-bit integers. Range: -32,768 to 32,767. Uses 2 bytes of memory.
*   **`int32`**: Represents signed 32-bit integers. Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Uses 4 bytes of memory.
*   **`int64`**: Represents signed 64-bit integers. Range: -(2^63) to 2^63 - 1. Uses 8 bytes of memory.

### Unsigned Integers

Unsigned integers can only represent non-negative numbers (zero and positive). This effectively doubles the positive range for a given bit size compared to signed integers.

*   **`uint`**: The unsigned counterpart to `int`. Its size matches `int` (32 or 64 bits).
*   **`uint8`**: Represents unsigned 8-bit integers. Range: 0 to 255. Uses 1 byte of memory.
*   **`uint16`**: Represents unsigned 16-bit integers. Range: 0 to 65,535. Uses 2 bytes of memory.
*   **`uint32`**: Represents unsigned 32-bit integers. Range: 0 to 4,294,967,295. Uses 4 bytes of memory.
*   **`uint64`**: Represents unsigned 64-bit integers. Range: 0 to 2^64 - 1. Uses 8 bytes of memory.

### Special Integer Aliases

*   **`byte`**: An alias for `uint8`. Commonly used for representing raw byte data.
*   **`rune`**: An alias for `int32`. Used to represent Unicode code points.

### When to Use Which Integer Type:

*   **General Use:** `int` is usually sufficient for most general-purpose integer needs.
*   **Memory Optimization:** If you are dealing with a large collection of numbers that are guaranteed to be small (e.g., ages, flags), using smaller types like `uint8` or `int8` can save memory.
*   **Large Values:** For very large numbers that might exceed the capacity of `int` (especially on 32-bit systems), use `int64` or `uint64`.
*   **Guaranteed Range:** If you need to ensure a specific bit size and range regardless of the underlying architecture, use the fixed-size types (e.g., `int32`, `uint16`).
*   **Non-Negative Values:** Use unsigned integers when the value will always be zero or positive.

## Floating-Point Types

Go provides two floating-point types for representing numbers with decimal points.

*   **`float32`**: Uses 32 bits. Offers less precision and a smaller range.
*   **`float64`**: Uses 64 bits. Offers greater precision and a larger range. This is the **default and recommended** type for floating-point numbers in Go.

### When to Use Which Float Type:

*   **General Use & Precision:** Always prefer `float64` unless you have a very specific reason not to. It provides better precision, which is crucial for most calculations, especially in scientific, financial, or graphical applications.
*   **Memory Optimization:** `float32` can be considered if you are working with massive datasets of floating-point numbers where memory usage is a critical constraint, and the reduced precision is acceptable.
*   **Interoperability:** Sometimes, you might need to use `float32` if you are interfacing with external libraries or hardware that specifically requires it.

**Important Consideration:** Floating-point arithmetic can sometimes lead to small precision errors. For financial calculations requiring exact decimal representation, consider using specialized libraries (like `shopspring/decimal`) or representing monetary values as integers (e.g., in cents).
